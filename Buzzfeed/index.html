        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic sent shockwaves through every facet of society, impacting daily life, economies, and overall health and well-being. Despite the closure of cherished communal spaces and the prohibition of social gatherings, residents of New York sought comfort in parks and recreation areas.</p>
        <p>Data collected by the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Recreation/State-Park-Annual-Attendance-Figures-by-Facility-B/8f3n-xj78"> New York State Office of Parks, Recreation & Historic Preservation (OPRHP)</a> revealed that in 2020, the state’s 214 parks and historic sites experienced a record-breaking attendance of 78 million visits, marking a 1.2% increase from the previous year. However, the positive trend wasn’t universal across all sites.</p>
        <p>Analyzing the attendance patterns of the three most frequented parks and recreation sites in New York—Niagara Falls State Park, Robert Moses State Park, and Jones Beach State Park—from 2018-2022 provides valuable insights into the diverse challenges faced by these spaces during the pandemic.</p>

        <img class="photo" src="css/images/chart1.png" alt="Chart of attendance numbers from the top 3 most visited parks and recreation sites in New York from 2018 to 2022">

        <p>While Robert Moses ranks as the third most frequented site in New York, its pre-COVID peak attendance was below half of that of the second-ranking Jones Beach State Park. However, in 2020, Robert Moses experienced a notable 39% surge in attendance, reaching nearly six million visitors and nearly securing the second spot by a margin of approximately 40,000 visitors.</p>
        <p>“Early on in the season, where we wouldn't see as heavy attendance, we were just inundated at many of our facilities, including Robert Moses,” said Marc Talluto, Deputy Commissioner for Operations, OPRHP. “Robert very much services a large part of Suffolk County, and they just showed up in droves to that facility.”<p>
        <p>Talluto’s observations align with the sentiments expressed by Erik Kulleseid, Commissioner of the New York State OPRHP, who emphasized the parks’ role in providing solace to visitors during challenging times.</p>
        <p>“On the human side, I think that the people who came to our parks to find solace and comfort and relief was really amazing,” Kulleseid said. “We were so proud to be the place where people could find respite and could socialize. We had families, friends who couldn't see each other otherwise who came to our parks.”</p>

        <p>However, the nearby Jones Beach State Park didn’t experience that same influx of attendance in 2020, with only a 1.9% increase, or about 150,000 visitors, from the previous year. Talluto attributes this to transit restrictions in New York City, which made Jones Beach less accessible compared to Robert Moses, whose visitors are more centrally located.</p>
        <p>“Robert Moses is really a Long Island Park,” Talluto said. “Jones, on the other hand, really pulls from a variety of different areas— it's partly from New York City areas, partly from Queens and Brooklyn. As a much broader segment of society, I think [they] also probably had concerns about travel, and the results of mass transit restrictions probably helped manage the in-flow.”</p>
        <p>Talluto’s perspective resonates with the notion put forth by him and Kulleseid, emphasizing the psychological first aid provided by parks during a time of global distress.</p>
        <p>“In a country, nation, world in distress, green spaces and open spaces being a safer place to be provided an avenue for a lot of people to process what was going on,” Talluto said.</p>
        <p>However, the pandemic massively impacted attendance numbers for Niagara Falls. In a surprising turn of events, 2020 marked the end of a 17-year streak as the most visited park in New York. Attendance plummeted from 9.6 million to just below six million, a 38% decrease, with Jones Beach taking the top spot.</p>
        <p>“A lot of Niagara Falls' attendance is international,” Talluto said. “They get a lot of [attendees] between Canada and other countries— it's a world renowned facility. So clearly, international travel came to a halt, but it still managed to pull a pretty healthy attendance with travel restrictions.”</p>


        <p>Regardless of the atypical drop in attendance at Niagara Falls in 2020, Kulleseid thinks that the numbers are even more impressive when considering the restrictions the parks had in place during this time. One of those restrictions was a capacity limit at all parks during peak visitation season.</p>
        <p>“We were imposing attendance restrictions, trying to keep attendance down by 50%,” Kulleseid said.</p>
        <p>In 2021, attendance at these three parks returned to levels similar to those before 2020. For Robert Moses, this meant a decrease of almost two million visitors.</p>
        <p>“Early on, during the pandemic, we were the only thing that was open for recreation and leisure activity,” Talluto said. “Virtually everything else was closed, so people had no other outlet. I think as other outlets opened up, people were able to not only manage where they went, but they were returning to work, which means they had less time during the week to attend these facilities.”</p>

        <p>However, overall attendance at the parks is still steadily increasing, hitting just short of 80 million in 2022. With many people discovering these parks for the first time during the pandemic and recognizing their value, combined with OPRHP celebrating its centennial next year, Kulleseid anticipates that the effects of the pandemic may contribute to increased attendance and continued improvement in the coming years.</p>
        <p>“Our centennial is next year, and [we’re] really looking to that to help boost attendance and keep it up,” Kullesied said. “We're expanding and improving all the time. We're robust, and we hope we'll have a special number of visitors coming this year after we wrap up 2023.”</p>
